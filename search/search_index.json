Collectively, this intended use enables molecular diagnostic applications for detecting difficult-to-lyse pathogens in human biological specimens in a variety of settings.</p> <p>The mechanisms by which the device achieves these intentions are a combination of heating to near-boiling liquid temperatures and rapid shaking (also known as \"bead beating\") to shear-force-inducing frequencies. Both mechanisms are important: the heating increases susceptibility of microorganisms to killing and lysis, which improves biosafety and contributes to lysis efficiency, and decreases nuclease activity, which stabilizes the released nucleic acids in the resulting lysate; the shaking drastically increases lysis efficiency, which releases more amplifiable nucleic acids into the resulting lysate than heating alone. We typically measure lysis efficiency by the quantity of amplifiable nucleic acids released from target cells in the sample.</p> <p>Data generated on this instrument at Global Health Labs (GHL), its original developer, show that for difficult-to-lyse cellular microorganisms, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), heating alone results in almost no lysis efficiency, while shaking alone (such as with a lab-grade bead beater or homogenizer) results in reduced lysis efficiency, compared to heating and shaking together. Therefore, we created the nPOC-BB instrument for you, the diagnostic test developer who requires a low-cost, portable, robust, and rapid method for the efficient preparation of a sample to be used in a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT).</p> <p>The goal of this documentation is to describe the nPOC-BB instrument as a stand-alone instrument whose principles may be replicated in commercial diagnostic (global) health care products, but the development of this specific instrument took place within the context of the development at GHL of NAATOS, a diagnostic system for the nucleic-acid-based detection of Mtb from human tongue swab specimens. However, because the nPOC-BB has also been shown to yield high lysis efficiency of Mtb in human sputum samples, which is an excellent model for a difficult-to-lyse organism in a challenging sample matrices, we believe this instrument will be useful beyond the original application\u2014a claim that of course must be validated in your own context.</p>"},{"location":"#contributors","title":"Contributors","text":""},{"location":"#global-health-labs-ghl","title":"Global Health Labs (GHL)","text":"<p>GHL is the lead developer of the nPOC-BB device, having invested in several areas of early stage research related to new tools and technologies for diagnosis of tuberculosis (and other endemic infectious disease) in low-resource settings.</p> <ul> <li>Lex Ball </li> <li>Josh Bishop </li> <li>Stephen Burkot </li> <li>Ryan Calderon </li> <li>Simon Ghionea </li> <li>Chin Ng Hei </li> <li>Isabel Izek </li> <li>Matt Keller </li> <li>Khushboo Khimani </li> <li>Andrew Miller </li> <li>Bryan Norton </li> <li>Julie Pendergraft </li> <li>Jamie Purcell </li> <li>Amy Steadman </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#central-centerless-grinding-ccgscitus-engineering","title":"Central Centerless Grinding (CCG)/Scitus Engineering","text":"<p>CCG is the hardware design and instrument manufacturing partner for the nPOC-BB and NAATOS systems.</p> <ul> <li>Philip Almquist</li> <li>Mark Flanagan<sup>1</sup></li> <li>James Paolino<sup>1</sup></li> <li>Ed Sienczylo</li> <li>David Sorenson</li> <li>Binh Tran</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#odic","title":"Odic","text":"<p>Odic is the electronics design partner for the nPOC-BB and NAATOS systems.</p> <ul> <li>Rob Filipkowski<sup>2</sup></li> <li>Liam Sullivan</li> <li>Ian O\u2019Neil</li> <li>Dylan Derose</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#market-access-africa-maa","title":"Market Access Africa (MAA)","text":"<p>MAA is the African healthcare market research partner for the nPOC-BB and NAATOS systems.</p> <ul> <li>Olawale Ajose<sup>3</sup> </li> <li>Obakeng Bagopi</li> <li>Zipporah Bundi</li> <li>Nancy Njoku-Attah</li> <li>Wambui Nyabero</li> <li>Pam Pillay<sup>3</sup> </li> <li>Newton Runyowa</li> <li>Chris Smit</li> <li>Shabnam Zavahir</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#health-innovation-advisors-hia","title":"Health Innovation Advisors (HIA)","text":"<p>HIA is the user research and implementation science partner for the nPOC-BB and NAATOS systems.</p> <ul> <li>Melissa Mugambi<sup>4</sup> </li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>Corresponding contributor for CCG.\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Corresponding contributor for Odic.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Corresponding contributor for MAA.\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Corresponding contributor for HIA.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"changes/alpha_to_gamma/","title":"Alpha to Gamma Design Updates","text":""},{"location":"changes/alpha_to_gamma/#prototype-version-comparison","title":"Prototype Version Comparison","text":"<p>The following table provides an overview of design differences between the nPOC-BB (Alpha) and (Gamma) prototypes developed at GHL.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The nPOC-BB (Beta) prototype has a nearly identical mechanical design to the nPOC-BB (Gamma) prototype, but the nPOC-BB (Beta) prototype has serious flaws in its electrical design, which are addressed by the nPOC-BB (Gamma) prototype and the v3.5 firmware.

Molecular diagnostic solutions exist in LMICs, but are mostly off-site, expensive to run and maintain, and often incur long waits for results from providers and patients.

These thermal and (bio)chemical techniques require significant cleanup to allow detection of those targets by biochemical assays and/or take too long to release molecular targets from Mtb. Sputum, the most common specimen type for TB diagnostics, adds its own challenges to sample preparation, as it is a highly viscous sample matrix containing mucins and other natural biochemical inhibitors. Therefore, alternate sample preparation techniques, and even alternate specimen types, are desirable innovations in the context of sample preparation for TB diagnostics.
