Cycle error enums,Explanation,When Does NOT Apply,Example Logfile Event Text,Notes
`CYCLE_ERROR_ACTUAL_RUNTIME_HAD_A_MISMATCH`,"When cycle is completed, the rtctime or cputicktime difference to `cycle_config.cycle_run_time` is within `cycle_config.accept_cycle_time_error`.",If any cycles in the run have a `cycle_config.ramp_to_temp_before_start_cycle` set to TRUE (would imply variable time behavior).<br/> If `cycle_config.accept_cycle_time_error` is 0.,Cycle run time error was beyond the configured threshold of 7.5 seconds.,Catches a severe time mismatch at the cycle level.
`CYCLE_ERROR_FINISHED_BUT_ACTUAL_RUNTIME_HAD_A_MISMATCH`,"When the whole run is completed otherwise successfully (right when the last cycle ends), but the whole run `rtctime` or `cputicktime` difference to the sum of all `cycle_config.cycle_run_time` s is greater than `config.accept_run_time_error_s`.",If any cycles in the run have a `cycle_config.ramp_to_temp_before_start_cycle` set to TRUE (would imply variable time behavior).<br/>If `config.accept_run_time_error_s` is 0.,Total run time taken error was beyond the configured threshold of 30 seconds.,Catches a severe time mismatch at the run level.
`CYCLE_ERROR_TIME_ERROR_BETWEEN_RTC_AND_CPUTICKS_DURING_RUN`,When a cycle is running and the `rtcelapsed` has diverged from `tickelapsed` by greater than `config.accept_run_time_error_s`,,Caught time-error beyond 30 sec between `RTCelapsed_s:50` & `TICKelapsed_s:4` while `cycle_run_time_s` was 30 sec,Catches the cycle never stopping problem we saw.
`CYCLE_ERROR_BUTTON_EXIT `,When the pushbutton is actuated during run.,,Cycle cancled via button.,
`CYCLE_ERROR_SENSOR_BREAK`,When the hall effect and/or optical sensor is switched during the run.,,Optical sensor interrupted.,
`CYCLE_ERROR_TIMEOUT_DURING_RAMP`,When ((time in the cycle elapsed) > `cycle_config.ramp_to_temp_timeout`) and any of the temperatures have not yet met or exceeded their respective setpoints in this cycle.,If `cycle_configs.ramp_to_temp_timeout` is 0.,Ramp to temp timed out. Stopping cycle.,
`CYCLE_ERROR_OVER_TEMP_BATTERY`,When battery temperature thermistor reading >= 59.0 degC,,Battery over temperature error.,
`ERR_TEMP_SENSOR_READ` / `CYCLE_ERROR_I2C_FAIL`,When temperature sensor could not be read correctly (in respective `sensor.c` file).,,I2C sensor read error.,
`ERR_OVERTEMP_EVENT` / `CYCLE_ERROR_OVER_TEMP`,When a temperature reading in a respective sensor zone is greater than it's configured setup (`config.heater_max_temp`),,Sample over temperature error.,
`CYCLE_ERROR_MOTOR_STALLED_PERCENT`,When motor RPM drops this PERCENT below the motor setpoint.,If motor is not configured to run in the cycle.<br/>If measured motor RPM has not yet met or exceeded the motor RPM setpoint in the current cycle.<br/>If `config.motor_stall_en` is FALSE.,Motor stalled detected due to drop in motor speed.,
`CYCLE_ERROR_MOTOR_STALLED_PWM`,When motor PWM control value exceeds `config.motor_stall_pwm`.,,Motor stalled detected due to an increase in PWM.,
Not a defined error / a watchdog reboot,Other uncaught error conditions or programming bugs. This will not show any explanation in logfile (because it's uncaught) but result in a reboot triggered by the hardware watchdog timer.,,,
