# 20240212 Technical Review (VCBB)

## Summary

An early version of heated bead beating technology developed at GHL used a voice coil to mechanically shake a tube with beads (instead of the scotch drive used in the nPOC-BB). The early version was therefore named the Voice Coil Bead Beater (VCBB). A [Technical Review](../reviews/20240212%20TR%20NAATOS%20v1%20VCBB%20Technical%20Review.pdf){:target="_blank"} was held ([Meeting Review Record](../reviews/20240214%20MRR%20NAATOS%20v1%20VCBB%20Handoff.pdf){:target="_blank"}) for the purpose of using the learnings from the VCBB work as draft inputs to the development of nPOC-BB.
