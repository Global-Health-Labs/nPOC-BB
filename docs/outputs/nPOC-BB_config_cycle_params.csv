Name,Description,Type,Default,Unit
`cycle_run_time_s`,The duration of the cycle.,float,51,s
`accept_cycle_time_error_s`,"The acceptable timing error for the cycle, evaluated at the conclusion of the cycle. Time is measured by real-time clock (RTC) and cpu-ticks, which are then compared. If the measured time differential exceeds this value, then an error occurs, the run exits, and the unit notifies the user that the sample is now invalid (red lights notification). **This condition is evaluated in addition to the global condition `accept_run_time_error_s`.",float,15,s
`cycle_delay_time_s`,**DO NOT USE. Leave at 0.**,uint16,0,s
`ramp_to_temp_before_start_cycle`,The enable for starting the cycle duration timer after the heater board has reached the heater setpoint in the cycle.,bools,FALSE,-
`ramp_to_temp_timeout`,"The duration allowed for the heater board temperature to reach the heater setpoint in this cycle, beyond which the unit will alert. **This parameter will take effect regardless of `ramp_to_temp_before_start_cycle` TRUE or FALSE.**",float,50,s
`yellow_grace_period_s`,"The duration for this cycle in which an error will not cause the sample to be invalid (i.e., yellow lights notification instead of red lights notification).",float,51,s
`heater_setpoint`,The target temperature of the heater board for the heater PID controller in this cycle.,float,100,°C
`motor_setpoint`,The target speed of the motor for the motor PID controller in this cycle.,uint16,0,RPM
`run_heater_enable`,The enable for running the heater in this cycle.,bools,TRUE,-
`run_motor_enable`,The enable for running the motor in this cycle.,bools,FALSE,-
`heater_kp`,The proportional control constant used by the heater PID controller in this cycle.,float,20,-
`heater_ki`,The integral control constant used by the heater PID controller in this cycle.,float,0.05,-
`heater_kd`,The derivative control constant used by the heater PID controller in this cycle.,float,50,-
`motor_kp`,The proportional control constant used by the motor PID controller in this cycle.,float,0.005,-
`motor_ki`,The integral control constant used by the motor PID controller in this cycle.,float,0.0005,-
`motor_kd`,The derivative control constant used by the motor PID controller in this cycle.,float,0.02,-
