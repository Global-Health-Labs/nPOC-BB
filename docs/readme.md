# Near-Point-of-Care Bead Beater (nPOC-BB)

## Overview

The Near-Point-of-Care Bead Beater (nPOC-BB) is a portable laboratory instrument designed to prepare challenging samples for nucleic acid amplification tests by efficiently releasing amplifiable genomic DNA from difficult-to-lyse microorganisms.

This repository contains the design and data files related to development and evaluation of the nPOC-BB in the context of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Mtb) detection in tongue swab or sputum specimens.
