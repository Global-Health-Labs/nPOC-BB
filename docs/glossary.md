# Glossary

`Global Health Labs (GHL)`

:   A non-profit organization responsible for development of the nPOC-BB prototypes.

`lateral flow assay (LFA)`

:   A type of diagnostic format comprising biochemical assay reagents dried into porous materials arranged into a strip. An LFA user will wet the input end of the strip with a liquid sample, such as urine, diluted mucus, or blood, which then transports along the strip, rehydrating and reacting with the reagents in order to yield a visual signal of the presence or absence of a specific analyte in the sample. Also sometimes referred to as a lateral flow test (LFT) or lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), the latter due to antibodies being common assay reagents for capture and labeling of an analyte on the strip. The canonical example of an LFA is the pregnancy test strip, which is used on human urine to detect human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).

`molecular test / nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)`

:   A diagnostic test that can detect the presence of a molecular target, often a nucleic acid sequence specific to a pathogen or other diagnostic target, in very low quantities (down to a single molecule), often through a biochemical amplification of the molecular target. Such testing is often only possible to perform in a well-resourced diagnostic laboratory setting. For an example of an effort to make NAATs more broadly available, see **[NAATOS][1]**.

`Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb)`

:   A species of pathogenic bacteria in the family Mycobacteriaceae and the causative agent of the infectious disease tuberculosis.

`NAATOS: Nucleic Acid Amplification Test On a Strip`

:   A technology under development at GHL combining the low-cost and availability of lateral flow assay (LFA) testing with molecular testing.

`Near-Point-of-Care Bead Beater (nPOC-BB)`

:   A portable sample preparation instrument designed to prepare *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* from human tongue swab specimens for detection of TB via molecular testing in low-resource settings. Will also work with liquified human sputum specimens and may be useful in other sample preparation applications. Originally developed as a component of the **[NAATOS][1]** system, it is sometimes called the Sample Preparation Module (SPM).
